  "body": "# Welcome to Text To Images - created by Jackie Gerstein\r\n\r\n## Important Message\r\n* Please do not distribute this program yourself. If you have friends who want to use it, please direct them here so they can get the updated version as I continue to improve it. The user interface is about the most minimal possible just to get it working - improvements are coming, along with new features.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n* This is still very much in development and directions will be changing.\r\n* Download the [TextToImages.exe](https://github.com/gersteinj/text_to_images/blob/master/dist/TextToImages.exe) file by clicking on the link and choosing \"View Raw\"\r\n* Run the file. You may get a command line popping up, that's okay.\r\n* Further directions will be displayed by the program\r\n* This version is Windows only. I'll post a Linux version soon. Sorry to the OSX users out there - I can't compile it for you without access to a Mac. If you want to use it and don't have access to Windows, let me know - there's a way to use it, it's just a lot less convenient.\r\n* If you wish to choose your own colors, please use standard HTML color names. [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) has a helpful list.\r\n\r\n## Questions/suggestions/comments\r\n* If you have questions or suggestions, please reach out to me at gersteinj@gmail.com or as @gersteinj\r\n\r\n## Preparing Your Word List\r\n* You'll need a text file with each word/phrase on a single line. If that made sense, you can skip the rest of this section and just set up your file. Otherwise, the next few steps are for you.\r\n* Open up a text editor. I like Notepad++, but any text editor should work. The default for OSX is Textedit, and the default for Windows is Notepad. The default for Linux depends on the variety of Linux you have - a quick search should help if you don't know what text editor you have installed.\r\n* Set up your word list. Remember, each line will become an image file.\r\n* Save your file somewhere that you can find it again.",
