# Text To Images

## Important Message
* Please do not distribute this program yourself. If you have friends who want to use it, please direct them here so they can get the updated version as I continue to improve it. You can send them to this page or to my [website](http://www.robotsinheels.com), which has a link to access this page as well. The user interface is about the most minimal possible just to get it working - improvements are coming!
* I haven't had time to test in Linux yet, and I don't have a Mac to test on, but both operating systems should work. Please let me know if they don't.
* If you have questions or suggestions, please reach out to me at gersteinj@gmail.com or as @gersteinj on Twitter. Feel free to get hold of me here, too, if you're comfortable with Git/GitHub.

## Getting Started
* This is still very much in development and directions will be changing.
* Download the [TextToImages.exe](https://github.com/gersteinj/text_to_images/blob/master/dist/TextToImages.exe) file by clicking on the link and choosing "View Raw"
* Run the file. You may get a command line popping up, that's okay.
* Select your word list
* Select the folder you want to save your images in
* When asked, type in a file name you want to use. Each image will be followed by a number

## Preparing Your Word List
* You'll need a text file with each word/phrase on a single line. If that made sense, you can skip the rest of this section and just set up your file. Otherwise, the next few steps are for you.
* Open up a text editor. I like Notepad++, but any text editor should work. The default for OSX is Textedit, and the default for Windows is Notepad. The default for Linux depends on the variety of Linux you have - a quick search should help if you don't know what text editor you have installed.
* Set up your word list. Remember, each line will become an image file.
* Save your file somewhere that you can find it again..

## Settings
* Settings beyond file name will be available shortly
